# 18. Advanced Topics and Applications

---

## 1. Space Complexity and PSPACE

- **PSPACE:** Decision problems solvable with polynomial space.
- **PSPACE-complete:** Hardest problems in PSPACE.
- Many games (generalized chess, go, etc.) are PSPACE-complete.

---

## 2. Savitch’s Theorem

- NSPACE(s(n)) ⊆ DSPACE(s(n)^2)
- Non-determinism does not provide exponential space advantage.

---

## 3. Hierarchy Theorems

- More time/space gives more computational power.
- **Time Hierarchy Theorem:** More time allows solving strictly more problems.

---

## 4. Randomized Complexity Classes

- **BPP:** Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time.
- **RP, ZPP:** Other probabilistic classes.

---

## 5. Interactive Proofs (IP)

- Proofs where a verifier interacts with a prover.
- **IP = PSPACE** (powerful result).

---

## 6. Quantum Computation

- **BQP:** Bounded-error quantum polynomial time.
- Can solve some problems (e.g., factoring) faster than classical algorithms.

---

## 7. Descriptive Complexity

- Logical descriptions of complexity classes.
- E.g., “P” corresponds to first-order logic with a fixed-point operator.

---

## 8. Parameterized Complexity

- Classifies problems based on multiple parameters.
- **FPT:** Fixed-parameter tractable.

---

## 9. Approximation Algorithms

- For NP-hard optimization problems, seek near-optimal solutions.
- **Approximation ratio:** How close the algorithm gets to optimal.

---

## 10. Applications in Real World

- Cryptography: Relies on hard problems (factoring, discrete log).
- Compiler design: Automata and grammars.
- Artificial Intelligence: Search, complexity of inference.
- Bioinformatics: Sequence alignment (NP-hard).

---

## 11. Probabilistic and Non-uniform Computation

- **Advice strings, circuits, P/poly class.**
- Relates to cryptography and hardness assumptions.

---

## 12. Kolmogorov Complexity

- Measures the minimum description length of a string (information theory meets computation).

---

## Interview Patterns

- Discuss the impact of quantum computing on complexity.
- Explain the difference between deterministic and randomized complexity.
- Apply approximation algorithms to NP-hard problems.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing space and time complexity.
- Overestimating the power of quantum computers (not magic!).
- Assuming approximation always gives good solutions.

---

## Exercises

1. Explain the difference between PSPACE and NP.
2. What is BPP? Give an example of a problem in BPP.
3. Describe an approximation algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem.
4. What is Kolmogorov complexity, and why is it important?
